Detailed Design doc on myToDoApp

Introduction: myToDoApp is a task management library which allows the user to add, delete tasks and also see the total and individual counts of the task. The user enters a new task and it gets added on the first board. User can drag and drop the tasks in different boards and can also drag it to the delete icon to trash it. It also has a theme change feature to switch themes, which takes action upon click of the right corner icon on the header.

Implementation: ‪Entire code is generic so it can be extended to host ’n’ number of boards and tasks. I chose this path since it allows the other developers to use the same plugin to extend at their will. All the ‪DOM manipulation is done before inserting in DOM, hence the performance is fast.‬ ‪Use of extensible options object with predefined default options to make sure the user does not need to specify default every time.‬

External Libraries: Bootstrap.min.css, jquery-3.1.1.min.js, Sortable.js
